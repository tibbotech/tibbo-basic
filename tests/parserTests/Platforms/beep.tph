'The pattern string defines the pattern, for example: "B-B-B~*".

'The meaning of characters:
'<br><br>
''-': No sound (no square wave output).
'<br><br>
''B' or 'b': Beep (generate square wave output).
'<br><br>
''~': Looped pattern. This character can be inserted anywhere in the pattern string. 
'<br><br>
''*': Double the speed of playing this pattern. Can be inserted anywhere in the pattern string. Applies to the entire string. You can use up to two * characters, meaning that you can quadruple the normal speed of the output. 
'<br><br>
'At the normal speed, each step is 200 ms long. Therefore, the step duration is 100ms when the speed is doubled (*) and 50ms when the speed is quadrupled (**).

'The patint argument determines if this method's invocation is allowed to interrupt another pattern that is already playing.
