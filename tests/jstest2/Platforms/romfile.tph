object romfile
'The romfile object allows you to access resource (fixed) files that you have added to your project.
'Resource files appear under the "Resource Files" branch of your project tree.
'Resource files are not processed by the compiler in any way, they are just added to the compiled project binary "as is".
'<br><br>
'Resource files are ideal for storing permanent data that never changes.

'Returns a <i>16-bit </i>value indicating the file position at which the specified occurrence of the substring was found or 0 if the specified occurrence wasn't found.

'This method was preserved for compatibility with previously developed applications. You are recommended to use romfile.find32 -- it has no file size limitations.
