object io
'The io. object controls the I/O lines, 8-bit I/O ports, and interrupt lines of your device.
'<br><br>
'The lists of available I/O lines, ports, and interrupt lines are platform-specific and are defined by pl_io_num, pl_io_port_num, and  pl_int_num enums.
'<br><br>
'On this platform, the I/O lines are unidirectional, i.e. you must configure each I/O line to be an output or an input, as it can't be both at the same time.
'This is done through io.enabled and io.portenabled properties.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------
event(19) on_io_int(linestate as byte)
'<b>EVENT of the io. object.</b><br><br>
'Generated when a change of state (from LOW to HIGH or from HIGH to LOW) on one of the enabled interrupt lines is detected.
'<br><br>
'Each bit of the linestate argument corresponds to one interrupt line in the order, in which these lines are declared in the pl_int_num enum.
'A bit value of 1 indicates that this line has CHANGED. Several lines may be reported as changed in a single call to on_io_int.
'<br><br>
'All interrupt lines are disabled by default and must be enabled individually through the io.intenabled property.
'<br><br>
'Another on_io_int event will not be generated until the previous one is processed.
'The consequence is that if the first enabled interrupt line changes its state, and then the second enabled interrupt line changes its state while the first on_io_int event hasn't yet been processed,
'then the second event will be lost.
